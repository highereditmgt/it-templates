Information Technology departments need to document their policies and
procedures.

This repository is for open-sourced templates that IT departments can
use.

The official source for this repository is on [github]. Templates are in
markdown format. A provided Makefile uses `multimarkdown` to convert
into HTML and `pandoc` to convert into DOCX (MS Word format).
